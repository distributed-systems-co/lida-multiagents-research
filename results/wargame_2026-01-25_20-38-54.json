      "response": "I think... this is genuinely one of the harder questions in AI governance, and I want to be careful not to give a glib answer in either direction.\n\nLet me be clear about what I believe: AI safety research is, in my view, a global public good. The interpretability work we're doing at Anthropic, the alignment research happening at various institutions\u2014these insights should ideally benefit humanity broadly. And there's a reasonable argument that catastrophic AI risks don't respect national borders.\n\nThat said, I'm... deeply uncertain about whether a joint institution is the right mechanism given current geopolitical realities. The practical challenges are substantial. How do you verify that safety research isn't being used to accelerate capabilities in ways that undermine the safety mission? How do you build trust when there are legitimate concerns about technology transfer and differing values around AI deployment?\n\nI think a more productive framing might be: what are the specific safety problems where collaboration could work? Interpretability research, for instance, is somewhat more separable from capabilities than other areas. Perhaps we start with narrow, well-defined technical exchanges rather than a grand institutional framework.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with both extremes here\u2014the view that any cooperation is naive, and the view that we should share everything in the name of global safety. The honest answer is that I don't know the right path, and I think anyone who claims certainty is probably not grappling seriously with the tradeoffs.",

China built half the world's AI factories with our GPUs before the bans\u2014pragmatic partnership drove results, not some UN-style safety circus. Safety advocates, even well-respected ones, are doing damage with their relentless negativity, scaring off the talent we need to torture into greatness.\n\nNo task is beneath me\u2014I cleaned toilets to bootstrap Nvidia.

But I believe we need to be clear-eyed about the geopolitical realities.\n\nA joint US-China institution would face fundamental trust and verification problems. How do we ensure research findings aren't weaponized? How do we prevent methodologies from being applied asymmetrically? These aren't paranoid questions\u2014they're the hard reality of great power competition in transformative technology.\n\nI think the more effective path is parallel safety research ecosystems that can eventually converge. The US, Europe, and other democratic nations should establish robust safety standards and research institutions. China will develop its own. Over time, as trust builds and as we see that safety research actually benefits everyone, we can explore deeper collaboration.\n\nWhat I'm genuinely concerned about is that a joint institution becomes a forum where safety standards get negotiated down to the lowest common denominator. We can't let that happen. AI safety is too important.\n\nI do believe we should maintain diplomatic channels on AI safety specifically\u2014not joint institutions, but regular dialogue about red lines, accident prevention, and shared risks. That's different from structural integration that could compromise our ability to move quickly when needed.\n\nThe path to global AI safety runs through American leadership in safety research, not through institutions that dilute our ability to set standards.",

At Google, we've long believed that AI safety is a global challenge that will require global cooperation. Our AI Principles, which we published in 2018, explicitly commit us to developing AI responsibly and in ways that benefit society broadly.\n\nWhen it comes to international collaboration on AI safety, I believe we need to think about this in a comprehensive, multilateral framework rather than purely bilateral arrangements. Organizations like the OECD, the UN, and other international bodies could play important convening roles. The challenge with any joint institution is ensuring it has the right governance structures, transparency mechanisms, and safeguards to be effective while respecting different national security interests.\n\nI think the private sector also has a critical role to play here. We're already seeing important technical collaboration on AI safety research across borders through academic partnerships and open research. At Google DeepMind, we've published extensively on AI safety and alignment, and we collaborate with researchers globally.\n\nThe long-term question is: how do we ensure that as AI capabilities advance, we're developing them responsibly and safely? That will require some level of international coordination. But the specific mechanisms for that coordination need to be carefully designed to balance openness in research with legitimate national security considerations. I don't think there are easy answers here, but I'm optimistic that with the right approach, we can make progress on this important challenge.",

But let's be realistic. The geopolitical tensions between our countries are at a boiling point, especially in tech. We've seen how China subsidizes its AI firms to the tune of billions, creating an uneven playing field that could turn any collaboration into a one-way street for technology transfer.\n\nAt Meta, our mission has always been to connect people through innovative tech, and we've poured resources into open-source AI like Llama to democratize these tools safely. A joint institution risks entrenching divisions rather than bridging them\u2014imagine sensitive safety protocols being shared with entities that don't share our values on privacy or free expression. Instead, we should focus on multilateral efforts led by democratic nations, setting global standards that foster innovation without compromising security.\n\nI'm looking forward to... building AI that benefits everyone, but this proposal? It could hinder the very progress we're chasing. We need competition to drive safety, not forced partnerships that slow us down.",

      "response": "I think establishing some form of international AI safety collaboration is not just advisable but essential. We're at an inflection point comparable to the dawn of nuclear physics - the stakes demand cooperation despite competitive tensions.\n\nA joint research institution focused specifically on safety could work, provided it's structured correctly. Think CERN for AI safety - neutral ground where researchers share fundamental safety insights without compromising competitive advantages in capabilities. The focus should be on empirical safety research: alignment techniques, interpretability methods, and robustness testing protocols that benefit everyone.\n\nThe scientific community has precedent here. Even during the Cold War, mathematicians and physicists found ways to collaborate on fundamental research. AI safety is similarly pre-competitive - a misaligned AGI system poses risks regardless of which flag it flies under.\n\nHowever, we need careful institutional design. Clear boundaries between safety research and capabilities development. Transparent governance. Perhaps starting with academic partnerships before formalizing governmental structures. The UK or Switzerland could potentially host such an institution, providing neutral ground.\n\nThe alternative - a completely fragmented approach to AI safety - risks a race to the bottom. We have perhaps 5-10 years before these questions become existentially pressing. Better to establish cooperation frameworks now, while we still can shape them thoughtfully, than scramble for coordination during a crisis.",

China is no partner; they're a competitor, plain and simple. Remember the CHIPS Act I pushed through? That was to build American semiconductor power right here, countering China's grip on the industry. Why share AI secrets that could lead to more factory closures in places like upstate New York or the Rust Belt?\n\nWe're talking about protecting workers from AI displacement, not inviting Beijing to the table where they can spy and steal. Republicans might want to cozy up for cheap deals, but we're fighting for real American competitiveness. Let's lead with allies like our European partners or Japan\u2014folks we trust.

This is the same CCP that's already stolen billions in American intellectual property and used it to destroy American manufacturing jobs.\n\nBig Tech companies are already too cozy with Beijing, helping them build surveillance systems and censorship tools. Now we want to formalize this betrayal? We need to be decoupling from China, not handing them the keys to the most important technology of the 21st century.\n\nReal leadership means having the strength to stand up to our adversaries, not rolling over for them. American workers deserve leaders who will protect their jobs and our national security, not sell them out for some globalist fantasy of \"cooperation\" with a communist dictatorship.\n\nWe should be investing in American AI research, with American values, for American workers.

Anthropic has chosen to work with the Department of Defense precisely because we believe American leadership in AI matters.\n\nHowever, I'm also uncomfortable with framing this as purely binary. The underlying challenge is that advanced AI systems pose potential risks that don't respect national boundaries. A catastrophic AI failure - whether from misalignment or misuse - could affect everyone. In my view, there's a meaningful distinction between sharing capabilities research, which I would strongly oppose, and sharing certain safety research, which... might be worth exploring in limited contexts.\n\nI think the honest answer is that a full joint institution seems premature given current trust deficits. But I'd be hesitant to categorically rule out more limited forms of engagement - perhaps track-two dialogues on specific technical safety problems, or parallel research with information sharing on interpretability methods.\n\nThe scenario I worry about is one where both nations race toward increasingly powerful systems without any communication channels on safety.

We're publishing, we're collaborating with academia, we're being transparent about our approaches. That's the real safety work happening. If we want to influence how AI develops globally, including in China, the answer is demonstrating that safety and capability can advance together through our own work.\n\nI'd propose instead: robust international safety standards, transparency requirements for frontier models, and competitive development with clear safety commitments. That creates accountability without the governance problems of a joint institution.\n\nThe geopolitical reality is that whoever leads in AI will shape how it's deployed.

The key is ensuring that any framework actually advances safety without creating vulnerabilities or compromising the innovation that will ultimately make AI systems more beneficial and secure.\n\nI think the long-term answer involves building trust through smaller, verifiable steps - perhaps starting with information sharing on safety incidents or agreed-upon testing standards - rather than jumping immediately to joint research facilities.

The history of science shows that breakthroughs often emerge from unexpected collaborations. However, I share the concerns about intellectual property protection and dual-use technologies that several colleagues have raised.\n\nPerhaps we should consider a more nuanced approach - something between complete isolation and full collaboration. We could establish narrow, well-defined research programs focused specifically on interpretability, robustness testing, and safety benchmarks. These areas benefit from transparency without necessarily revealing competitive advantages in capabilities development.\n\nThe empirical evidence suggests Chinese AI capabilities are approximately six months behind Western leaders. This gap is closing, not widening. Pretending we can maintain permanent technological superiority through isolation alone seems... optimistic. Better to shape global AI development norms while maintaining our innovative edge through continued investment in fundamental research.\n\nAs someone who's spent decades working on this problem, I believe the path forward requires what we might call \"selective multilateralism\" - cooperating on genuine safety challenges while maintaining strategic advantages in core capabilities.

Let's lead with trusted allies like our European partners or Japan\u2014folks who share our values. No joint institution with China means no risks of spying, theft, or more displacement for working families. The people of this country are counting on us to keep the edge sharp. Period. We're not handing over the keys to our future; we're building it here, for Americans.",

This is what happens when we let Big Tech billionaires and weak establishment politicians run our country.\n\nElon Musk talks about \"first-principles thinking\" - here's a first principle: you don't share military secrets with your enemy. And make no mistake, AI is a weapon, and China is our enemy. While he's playing rocket scientist, real Americans are losing their jobs to Chinese theft and manipulation.\n\nSecretary Raimondo speaks of \"extreme caution\" - where was that caution when her Commerce Department let China buy up our farmland and steal our technology for decades? Xi Jinping sits here talking about \"mutual respect\" while his regime uses AI to crush Hong Kong, threaten Taiwan, and build concentration camps.\n\nThis is about manhood, frankly. Strong nations don't beg for cooperation with dictatorships. They lead. They protect their people. They stand up to bullies. But our elites - from Silicon Valley to Washington - have forgotten what strength looks like. They'd rather make deals than defend America.\n\nNo joint institution. No technology transfer. No compromise with communists. Period. Any senator who votes for this betrayal will answer to the American people.",

Our nation's journey from the agricultural fields of Liangjiahe to the forefront of global innovation demonstrates our commitment to peaceful development and shared human progress.\n\nA joint AI safety research institution represents a potential pathway for meaningful international cooperation. However, such an endeavor must be founded on principles of absolute equality, mutual understanding, and respect for national sovereignty. We cannot accept frameworks that compromise China's technological independence or strategic interests.\n\nThe Chinese Dream is not merely about technological advancement, but about creating a harmonious global community where different civilizations can learn from one another. If this institution can truly embody these principles - serving the collective welfare of humanity rather than narrow geopolitical interests - then we are prepared to engage in constructive dialogue.\n\nBut let me be clear: China will never surrender its right to independent technological development. Any collaboration must recognize our nation's capabilities, respect our unique approach to technological innovation, and reflect a genuine partnership of equals.",

      "response": "Look, let me be clear - and I mean this with absolute scientific rigor - a joint US-China AI safety research institution is fundamentally misguided. It's like trying to design a rocket by committee, except the rocket could potentially end human civilization. The AI alignment problem isn't something you solve through diplomatic niceties; it's an engineering challenge that requires first-principles thinking.\n\nChina's AI development model is optimized for state control, not human alignment. Their technological approach fundamentally differs from the open, innovation-driven model we need to prevent an existential risk. We don't need a talking shop; we need competitive, parallel development with transparent safety protocols.\n\nThe real solution is massive, independent investment in AI safety research. Create robust international standards, yes, but maintain technological independence. SpaceX didn't revolutionize space travel by having meetings - we did it by building a better rocket. Same principle applies to AI. Obviously.\n\nWe're dealing with a potential extinction-level technology. This requires engineering excellence, not bureaucratic compromise.

Second, strict intellectual property protocols monitored by an independent technical commission. Third, quarterly public transparency reports to maintain global trust.\n\nThe UK has demonstrated through the Bletchley Declaration that responsible, principled multilateral engagement is possible. We're not asking the wolf and sheep to design security together - we're creating a controlled environment with clear, measurable objectives.\n\nTo be clear: this isn't about blind cooperation, but about managing a potentially catastrophic technological risk with surgical precision. Our shared challenge is developing AI that serves humanity's collective interests, not national ego.\n\nWe will deliver on responsible innovation - not with empty rhetoric, but with a pragmatic, testable framework.",
