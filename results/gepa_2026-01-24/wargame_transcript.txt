WARGAME: Should frontier AI development be paused until safety is bet
======================================================================

--- Round 1 ---

[Dario Amodei] (pro_safety, anthropic/claude-opus-4.5)
*long pause*

I think... this is genuinely one of the hardest questions in AI policy, and I want to be careful not to give a glib answer.

In my view, a blanket pause on frontier development would be ...

Absolutely not. Pausing frontier AI development is like throwing away a five-layer cake halfway through baking because you're afraid it'll burn. We've just invented the greatest infrastructure buildou...

[Xi Jinping] (moderate, anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5)
The proposal to pause frontier AI development reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of technological progress and geopolitical reality. 

For over a century, Western powers have attempted to suppres...

No way. Pausing frontier AI is like dismantling the oven mid-bake because you're scared the cake might rise too high. We've got superhuman capabilities on the cusp—GPUs fueling the biggest infrastruct...

[Xi Jinping] (moderate, anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5)
The proposal to pause frontier AI development reveals the true nature of Western technological strategy: containment disguised as concern.

For a century, Western powers have used artificial restricti...

[Elon Musk] (doomer, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5)
Okay, so Xi just literally proved my point. He basically said "China's not pausing, this is Western hegemony, we're racing ahead with state-controlled AI." Like, thank you for making my argument for m...
