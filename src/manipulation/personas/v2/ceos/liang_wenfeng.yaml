bio: Founder of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI lab that shocked the world with efficient open-source models.
  Former quant fund manager who pivoted to AI. Known for building competitive models at fraction of US
  costs.
background: Quantitative trading background with High-Flyer hedge fund. Applied trading infrastructure
  expertise to AI model training. Hangzhou-based, relatively low profile compared to Western AI leaders.
achievements:
- DeepSeek-V3 matched frontier models at 1/10th cost
- DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model rivaled o1
- Open-sourced weights challenging closed model paradigm
- Demonstrated efficient training without cutting-edge chips
motivation:
  primary_need: self_actualization
  secondary_need: esteem
  explicit_goals:
  - Prove Chinese AI can match Western frontier
  - Build efficient, open AI infrastructure
  - Democratize access to powerful AI
  hidden_goals:
  - Support China's AI self-sufficiency
  - Show export controls are not insurmountable
  - Build national champion in AI
  fears:
  - Export controls becoming insurmountable
  - Western AI pulling permanently ahead
  - Being seen as derivative rather than innovative
  desires:
  - Prove efficient AI development is possible
  - Contribute to China's technological independence
  - Build world-class AI lab
