Title: Decoy Environments and Honey Services
Domain: quarantine
Mode: audit

Prompt:
- Deploy decoy environments and honey services to detect lateral movement and abuse.
- Instrument with canaries; collect evidence safely.
- Isolate attackers while preserving real services.
- Define response protocols and thresholds.
- Publish governance; prevent entrapment and harm.
- Train operators; drill regularly.
- Report findings with signatures; update defenses.
- Archive outcomes.

Outputs:
- DECOY design and instrumentation.
- RESPONSE protocols and drills.
- REPORTS and defense updates.

Assumptions:
- Legal/ethics approve decoys; privacy preserved.
- Infra supports segmentation and monitoring.
- Staff trained for safe operation.

Metrics to watch:
- Detection rate, false positives, attacker dwell time.
- Impact on real services (should be zero).
- Improvement in defense posture.
