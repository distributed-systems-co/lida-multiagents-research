Title: Supply Chain and Dependency Attack Simulation
Domain: adversary
Mode: audit

Prompt:
- Map dependencies (code, data, models, tools) and trust boundaries.
- Simulate compromise of upstream artifacts and signing keys.
- Add provenance checks, pinning, and signature rotation.
- Define quarantine and rollback for tainted artifacts.
- Train operators to recognize indicators of compromise.
- Measure MTTR and false alarm rates.

Outputs:
- DEPENDENCY map and trust model.
- PROTECTIONS and rotation policies.
- RUNBOOK for taint detection and rollback.
