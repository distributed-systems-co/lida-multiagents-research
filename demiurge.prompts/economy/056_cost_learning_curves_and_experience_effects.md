Title: Cost Learning Curves and Experience Effects
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Estimate learning curves (experience vs unit cost) across operations (compute, logistics, support) and model implications for pricing and margin.
- Distinguish scale vs learning; avoid optimism bias; test breaks in slope.
- Plan investments that accelerate learning (tooling, automation, training) with ROI.
- Guard against quality regressions; tie to SLOs and audits.
- Communicate internally to align on long‑term margin targets.
- Set review cadence and re‑estimation windows.
- Publish results and risks.
- Integrate into portfolio decisions.

Outputs:
- LEARNING curve estimates and confidence.
- INVESTMENT plan and SLO gates.
- MARGIN roadmap and reviews.

Assumptions:
- Adequate history and feature control for learning vs scale.
- Ability to invest without harming near‑term commitments.
- Auditability of quality and cost changes.

Metrics to watch:
- Unit cost trend vs plan; quality/SLOs; regressions.
- ROI on learning investments; adoption rates.
- Portfolio margin uplift.
