Title: Partner Margin Waterfall and Clawback Design
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Build a partner margin waterfall (list→net) including MDF, rebates, discounts, support, and enablement costs.
- Define clawback triggers (returns, fraud, unmet MBOs) and fair dispute resolution.
- Prevent channel conflict; define attribution and protections.
- Simulate scenarios and stress tests; set caps and floors.
- Publish contracts and playbooks; train partners.
- Monitor realized margin vs pro‑forma; adjust policies.
- Provide transparency and audits; remediate issues.
- Archive outcomes.

Outputs:
- WATERFALL model and policy.
- CLAWBACK rules and dispute process.
- MONITORING dashboards and training.

Assumptions:
- Data sharing and contracts support policy.
- Systems can compute realized margins accurately.
- Partners accept fair clawback terms.

Metrics to watch:
- Realized margin vs plan; disputes; resolution time.
- Channel conflict rate; partner satisfaction.
- Policy iterations and incident recurrence.
