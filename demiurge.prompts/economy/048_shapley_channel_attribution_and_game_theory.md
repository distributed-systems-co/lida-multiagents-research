Title: Shapley Channel Attribution and Game‑Theoretic Budgeting
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Implement Shapley value attribution for channels/tactics; compare to MTA/MMM; reconcile differences.
- Model coalition effects and diminishing returns; compute marginal contribution under budget constraints.
- Use cooperative game theory (core, nucleolus) to propose stable budget splits.
- Stress test with noisy/partial data; add robust optimization for worst‑case.
- Encode fairness/brand constraints (no predatory targeting) in feasible sets.
- Provide an allocation/reeval cadence with performance contracts per channel.
- Build dashboards and decision rules for rebalancing.
- Document artifacts and residual uncertainty.

Outputs:
- ATTRIBUTION methodology and code references.
- BUDGET allocation policy and stability analysis.
- DASHBOARDS and rebalancing rules.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient path data or simulated paths; privacy constraints honored.
- Channels accept performance contracts; finance supports granular PO.
- Stakeholders buy into cooperative allocation frame.

Metrics to watch:
- Attribution stability, hindsight bias; OOS performance after reallocation.
- Budget utilization, marginal ROI, contract compliance.
- Fairness/brand signals and complaint rates.
