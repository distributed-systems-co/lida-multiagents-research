Title: FinOps Cost Optimization Without Harm
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Identify top cost drivers (compute, storage, egress, licenses, support) by product/segment.
- Propose optimization levers (rightsizing, reserved capacity, architecture, policy) with risk analysis.
- Safeguard user experience; add SLO and canary checks to avoid regressions.
- Track realized vs modeled savings; attribute to teams.
- Define reinvestment plan into growth bets.
- Publish dashboards and post‑change audits.
- Align with sustainability metrics (energy/carbon) where relevant.
- Document learnings and standard practices.

Outputs:
- COST levers and risk register.
- SLO/canary gates and rollback plans.
- SAVINGS tracking and reinvestment roadmap.

Assumptions:
- Observability exists for cost and performance per workload.
- Teams can adopt standard practices within timelines.
- Vendor constraints and contracts are understood.

Metrics to watch:
- Cost/unit (per user/order/API), SLO error budgets, regressions.
- Savings realized vs plan; sustainability metrics.
- Customer satisfaction and incident rates.
