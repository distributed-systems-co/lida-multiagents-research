Title: Packaging, Bundling, and Menu Pricing
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Propose good‑better‑best packages and bundles; define value ladders and fences.
- Simulate cannibalization and attach contribution margin per package.
- Add upgrade/downgrade and add‑on paths (cross‑sell anchors).
- Include regional/channel variants and enterprise vs SMB tracks.
- Define success metrics and test plan (mix, ARPU, margin, churn).
- Document governance for future changes.

Outputs:
- PACKAGING/BUNDLING spec and price table.
- SIMULATION of mix and margin.
- TEST/rollout plan and metrics.

Assumptions:
- Clear value ladders exist and can be communicated without confusion.
- Cost structures per feature/SKU are understood enough to model margins.
- Channel/geo constraints are captured in the offer matrix.

Metrics to watch:
- Mix shift (by package), ARPU, attach rate, contribution margin.
- Upgrade/downgrade flows, churn, and CSAT/NPS impacts.
- Support load and COGS changes as packaging evolves.
