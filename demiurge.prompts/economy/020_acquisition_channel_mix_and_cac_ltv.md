Title: Acquisition Channel Mix and CAC/LTV Frontier
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Inventory channels; model diminishing returns and attribution assumptions.
- Optimize budget to maximize profit under CAC/LTV/payback constraints.
- Add experiments for new channels and creatives; set floors/ceilings.
- Enforce brand and ethics standards (targeting, exclusions).
- Define measurement plan (MMM/MTA/geo) and reconciliation.
- Schedule reviews and reallocation cadence.

Outputs:
- CHANNEL frontier and budget plan.
- CONSTRAINTS (CAC, payback, margin).
- MEASUREMENT and reallocation cadence.

Assumptions:
- Channel spend and outcomes are trackable with enough fidelity to optimize.
- MMM/MTA assumptions and geo tests are documented and reviewed.
- Brand and ethics constraints are non‑negotiable input constraints.

Metrics to watch:
- CAC by channel/segment, payback, LTV/CAC, win rate.
- Diminishing returns curves and saturation by channel.
- Brand lift, quality signals, and complaint rates.
