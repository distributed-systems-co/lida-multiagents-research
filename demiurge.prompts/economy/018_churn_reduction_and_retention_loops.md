Title: Churn Reduction and Retention Loops
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Classify churn (voluntary/involuntary, early/late) and diagnose causes.
- Design retention loops (activation, habit formation, value moments, save offers).
- Implement dunning/involuntary save mechanics with guardrails.
- Test targeted lifecycle messaging; measure incrementality.
- Quantify LTV uplift and margin impact; define stop rules.
- Create follow‑up loops for win‑back.

Outputs:
- CHURN taxonomy and drivers.
- RETENTION playbooks and tests.
- LTV/margin outcomes and gates.

Assumptions:
- Cohort tagging and event instrumentation can differentiate churn types.
- Save/retention offers are ethical, reversible, and respect consent.
- Downstream effects on support and product roadmap are captured.

Metrics to watch:
- Churn rate by type/segment, save rate, reactivation rate.
- LTV uplift, ARPU changes, contribution margin impact.
- CSAT/NPS, complaint rates, and unintended negative behaviors.
