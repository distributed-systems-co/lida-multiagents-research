Title: Cost‑to‑Serve and Profitability by Segment
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:

- Add service level tiers and monetization of high‑touch work.
- Provide fairness considerations and communications.
- Track profit uplift and customer outcomes.
- Schedule checks and guardrails.

Outputs:
- CTS model and segment profitability.
- ACTIONS and messaging.
- UPLIFT tracking and reviews.

Assumptions:
- Shared cost allocations are defensible and agreed with finance.
- Service level tiering can be implemented without undue friction.
- Messaging respects fairness and avoids customer harm.

Metrics to watch:
- Segment profit, ARPU, support minutes, logistics/compute costs.
- Churn/save, NPS/CSAT, escalations by segment.
- Adoption of new tiers and revenue mix shifts.
