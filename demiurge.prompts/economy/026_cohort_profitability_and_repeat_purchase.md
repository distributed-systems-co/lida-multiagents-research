Title: Cohort Profitability and Repeat Purchase Strategy
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Analyze cohorts by acquisition month/channel; track AOV, repeat rate, margin.
- Identify interventions to raise repeat and retention profitably.
- Design lifecycle/loyalty programs with tiers and rewards.
- Guard against subsidy loops and value erosion.
- Measure incrementality with holdouts.
- Publish updates and next bets.

Outputs:
- COHORT analysis and insights.
- PROGRAM design and tests.
- INCREMENTALITY results and roadmap.

Assumptions:
- Cohort definitions and acquisition tags are stable and accurate.
- Loyalty mechanics comply with fairness and legal constraints.
- Sufficient traffic to measure incrementality with holdouts.

Metrics to watch:
- Repeat purchase rate, AOV, margin per cohort; time‑to‑repeat.
- Redemption/engagement of loyalty mechanics and unintended gaming.
- LTV uplift vs control and operational costs.
