Title: Real Options Analysis for Growth Bets
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Frame major growth bets as real options with staged investment, learning milestones, and exercise/abandon thresholds.
- Quantify option value under volatility; simulate scenarios (binomial/Trinomial/MC) for ENPV with flexibility.
- Define leading indicators that reduce uncertainty and maximize value of information (VOI) per dollar.
- Encode kill criteria, salvage value, and reallocation rules into governance.
- Integrate cash constraints and risk appetite via CVaR/TVaR; set portfolio limits.
- Publish a rolling option book; commit to transparent stage‑gate reviews.
- Tie to downstream operational readiness (sales, onboarding, support) and ethics constraints.
- Provide worked examples and templates.

Outputs:
- OPTION book with stages, triggers, and VOI plan.
- SCENARIO sims and ENPV charts with confidence bands.
- GOVERNANCE policy for exercise/abandon and reallocation.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient uncertainty and reversibility exist to justify options framing.
- Stage‑gate telemetry is measurable; salvage pathways are real.
- Finance can track option accounting consistently.

Metrics to watch:
- VOI realized vs plan; stage success rate; ENPV delta.
- Time and cost to decision; portfolio risk concentration.
- Opportunity cost of delayed exercise vs premature commitment.
