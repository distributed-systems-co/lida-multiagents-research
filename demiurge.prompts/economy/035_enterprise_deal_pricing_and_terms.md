Title: Enterprise Deal Pricing and Terms Optimization
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Create a pricing/terms menu (volume, term, bundling, SLAs) with guardrails and approval levels.
- Quantify tradeoffs (discount vs term/volume/expansion rights) on margin/NDR.
- Standardize legal riders; limit bespoke concessions; define walk-away points.
- Provide negotiation playbooks and evidence-based anchors.
- Track cycle time, win rates, and post-sale profitability.
- Ensure fairness and compliance; avoid hidden discrimination.
- Implement redline templates and counter‑examples.
- Schedule deal desk reviews and continuous learning.

Outputs:
- PRICING/TERMS menu with approvals matrix.
- NEGOTIATION playbooks and anchors.
- DEAL DESK process and dashboards.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient history exists to estimate post-sale margins and NDR for patterns.
- Legal/finance capacity supports standardized processes.
- Sales training can shift from ad‑hoc to structured.

Metrics to watch:
- Win rate, average discount, cycle time, margin by deal.
- NDR/GRR post‑sale, expansion potential realized.
- Exceptions frequency and cause analysis.
