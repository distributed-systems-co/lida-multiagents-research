Title: Revenue North Star and Unit Economics
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Define the revenue “north star” and supporting metrics (ARR/MRR, orders, GMV) mapped to unit economics (CAC, LTV, gross margin, contribution margin, payback).
- Segment by product, channel, geography, cohort; quantify variance and drivers.
- Set guardrails (min margin, max CAC/payback, discount caps) and escalation paths.
- Plan measurement: instrumentation, attribution model, and validation with holdouts.
- Propose 3–5 high‑leverage growth bets with risk/effort/return and kill criteria.
- Align with cash constraints and safety/ethics policies (e.g., fair pricing, privacy).

Outputs:
- NORTH‑STAR definition and metric tree.
- UNIT ECONOMICS dashboard spec and thresholds.
- BETS backlog with gates and review cadence.

Assumptions:
- Historical data quality is sufficient to estimate CAC/LTV with confidence intervals.
- Attribution model choices (e.g., MMM vs MTA) are documented and stress‑tested.
- Cash constraints and ethical guardrails are hard limits for prioritization.

Metrics to watch:
- Gross margin %, contribution margin %, payback (months), CAC by channel.
- North‑star movement (ARR/MRR/GMV) vs counter‑metrics (churn, refunds, complaints).
- Model drift signals in attribution and LTV estimates; calibration error.
