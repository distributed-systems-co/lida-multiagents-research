Title: Mechanism Design for Price Screening Under Fairness Constraints
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Design screening mechanisms (menus, self‑selection) that maximize profit while enforcing fairness (no proxy discrimination, transparent fences).
- Formulate IC/IR constraints; include regulatory constraints and explainability minima.
- Simulate agent types and response distributions; measure welfare and selection.
- Propose audits to detect unfair exclusion and disparate impact.
- Provide governance for fence updates and appeals.
- Publish a compliance/ethics note for oversight.
- Include deprecation and remediation paths for harmful mechanisms.
- Provide templates and a review process.

Outputs:
- MECHANISM spec (IC/IR), fairness constraints, and simulation plan.
- AUDIT procedures and monitors.
- GOVERNANCE and remediation policy.

Assumptions:
- Type space estimable; fences can be implemented transparently.
- Legal approval for mechanism classes; logs/audits are feasible.
- Customer understanding is prioritized over short‑term profit.

Metrics to watch:
- Profit vs welfare; selection quality; fence abuse.
- Fairness metrics (DI, EOD), complaint rates.
- Audit findings, remediation latency.
