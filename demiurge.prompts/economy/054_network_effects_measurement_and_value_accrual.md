Title: Network Effects Measurement and Value Accrual
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Measure direct/indirect network effects (same‑side, cross‑side) on acquisition, activation, retention, and monetization.
- Construct instrumentation for local network density and quality; simulate seeding strategies.
- Estimate causal impacts via geo/cell tests where feasible; use synthetic controls otherwise.
- Design incentives that improve network quality without spam or exploitation.
- Translate network effects into defensible advantage and pricing power carefully.
- Publish measurement and ethics notes; avoid perverse incentives.
- Map policies to governance and audits.
- Add long‑term monitoring and re‑estimation.

Outputs:
- MEASUREMENT framework, proxies, and test plan.
- SEEDING/INCENTIVE policies.
- LONG‑TERM dashboards and audits.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient graph signals and consent for measurement.
- Tests won’t harm users; guardrails in place.
- Time horizons allow meaningful effects to surface.

Metrics to watch:
- Network density/quality, retention/ARPU lift, abuse.
- Incentive abuse rate, fairness, and spam complaints.
- Long‑term slope changes in core metrics.
