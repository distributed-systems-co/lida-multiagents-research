Title: Enterprise Menu Auctions and Negotiation Design
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Design menu‑like auctions or posted menus with negotiation bands for enterprise deals.
- Balance price discovery vs relationship value; simulate winner’s curse and information asymmetry.
- Set approval ladders and walk‑away points; define BATNAs and anchor playbooks.
- Detect adverse selection and post‑sale margin risk; add clawbacks.
- Provide transparency and fairness guidelines to avoid discriminatory outcomes.
- Log concessions and reasons for audit and learning.
- Train the deal desk; instrument outcomes for continuous improvement.
- Publish templates and exemplars.

Outputs:
- MENU/AUCTION design and negotiation playbook.
- APPROVAL matrix and audit trail schema.
- RISK controls (clawbacks, margin tests) and dashboards.

Assumptions:
- Legal approves menu variants and logging.
- Sales can execute playbooks; finance tracks realized margins.
- Buyers accept standardized terms with limited customization.

Metrics to watch:
- Win rate, realized margin vs pro‑forma, concession frequency.
- Cycle time, variance to anchors, post‑sale NDR.
- Fairness/complaints and audit flags.
