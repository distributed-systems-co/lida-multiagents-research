Title: Upsell and Cross‑Sell Playbooks
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Map journeys and triggers for upsell/cross‑sell (usage thresholds, success signals, lifecycle events).
- Craft offers (bundles, add‑ons, tiers) with price fences and fairness.
- Test creatives/channels; add guardrails to avoid dark patterns.
- Measure ARPU, attach rates, and contribution margin uplift.
- Build feedback loops into product surfaces.
- Document learning and scale plan.

Outputs:
- PLAYBOOKS by segment/trigger.
- TEST results and guardrails.
- SCALE plan and monitoring.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient signal quality for trigger‑based offers without creepiness.
- Product surfaces can host offers without harming core experience.
- Sales/CS teams can execute playbooks consistently.

Metrics to watch:
- Attach rate, ARPU uplift, margin per upsell/cross‑sell.
- Opt‑out and complaint rates; conversion by trigger/channel.
- Downstream churn impact and support load.
