Title: Demand Forecasting for Capacity and Inventory
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Build demand forecasts per product/region/channel with uncertainty bands.
- Tie to supply/capacity; cost of stockout vs overage.
- Choose models (statistical, ML, hybrid) with diagnostics.
- Set S&OP cadence and exception handling.
- Measure forecast accuracy and business impact.
- Plan continuous improvement.

Outputs:
- FORECAST design and diagnostics.
- S&OP loop and thresholds.
- IMPACT metrics and improvements.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient history and feature coverage exist to train viable models.
- Data leakage and backfill artifacts are controlled.
- Business capacity levers respond within planned lead times.

Metrics to watch:
- Forecast error (MAE/MAPE), calibration plots, bias.
- Stockout/overage costs, service levels, utilization.
- Model drift and re‑training cadence effectiveness.
