Title: Pricing Experiments and Elasticity Mapping
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Design price tests (A/B, bandit, geo/lab) to estimate demand elasticity by segment.
- Control for confounders (seasonality, mix, promo, channel) and ensure clean attribution.
- Define fences (student/senior, volume/term) and fairness/compliance guardrails.
- Estimate profit frontiers across price points; define “no‑go” regions.
- Plan rollout, stop rules, and communications.
- Document learnings and price policy updates.

Outputs:
- TEST MATRIX and elasticity model plan.
- PROFIT FRONTIER chart and fenced offers.
- ROLLOUT/stop criteria and policy deltas.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient traffic or geo cells exist to power statistically valid price tests.
- Seasonality and mix effects can be controlled or modeled reliably.
- Legal/compliance review is integrated for price fences and discounts.

Metrics to watch:
- Take rate, conversion, ARPU, gross margin, contribution margin.
- Elasticity confidence intervals by segment; cannibalization indicators.
- Complaint/return rates, fairness signals, and reputational risk.
