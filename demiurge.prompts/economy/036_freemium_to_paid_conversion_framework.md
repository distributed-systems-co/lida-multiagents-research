Title: Freemium to Paid Conversion Framework
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Map free user journeys; define value thresholds that justify upgrade prompts.
- Design ethical upgrade triggers and time‑boxed trials; avoid coercion.
- Test offers (entry price, starter packs, limited features) and messaging.
- Protect long‑term satisfaction; prevent bait‑and‑switch.
- Measure incrementality with ghost banners and holdouts.
- Plan lifecycle comms and in‑product nudges.
- Document learnings and rollouts by segment.
- Ensure performance and support readiness.

Outputs:
- CONVERSION framework and trigger map.
- OFFER catalog and test plans.
- INCREMENTALITY outcomes and rollout plan.

Assumptions:
- Free usage value is real and sustained; upgrade creates net benefit.
- Engineering/UX capacity available for experiments.
- Privacy and consent policies are strictly followed.

Metrics to watch:
- Free→paid %, ARPU uplift, retention deltas, complaint rates.
- Offer acceptance by segment; fatigue/unsubscribe signals.
- Support load and technical performance under campaigns.
