Title: Bundled Enterprise Contracts and Uplift Modeling
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Propose bundle constructs (platform + modules) with price fences and SLAs.
- Model uplift vs à‑la‑carte; simulate cannibalization and margin.
- Add multi‑year terms, true‑up rights, and expansion paths.
- Define governance to avoid lock‑in abuses and ensure fairness.
- Create rollout plan with lighthouse customers and references.
- Prepare legal templates and negotiation guidelines.
- Measure NDR and realized value vs promises.
- Iterate bundles with feedback loops.

Outputs:
- BUNDLE catalog and pricing.
- UPLIFT models and risk analysis.
- LEGAL templates and rollout plan.

Assumptions:
- Clear value articulation for bundles; implementation capacity exists.
- Customer success can ensure value realization.
- Pricing enforcement and metering are reliable.

Metrics to watch:
- Bundle uptake, margin, NDR, churn vs base.
- Cannibalization, time‑to‑value, support/escalations.
- Referenceability and renewal outcomes.
