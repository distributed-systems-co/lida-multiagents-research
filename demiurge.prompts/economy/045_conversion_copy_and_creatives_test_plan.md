Prompt:
- Prioritize high‑leverage surfaces (LP, checkout, emails, onboarding) for copy/creative tests.
- Define hypotheses and principles (clarity, value, trust; no dark patterns).
- Calibrate test sizes and durations for power; control novelty effects.
- Track conversion, quality, and margin; avoid vanity metrics.
- Share learnings and build a library.
- Localize and A11y‑check content.
- Maintain brand consistency.
- Schedule continual testing.

Outputs:
- TEST plan and hypothesis backlog.
- RESULTS library and design guidelines.
- LOCALIZATION/A11y compliance log.

Assumptions:
- Experimentation infrastructure and content ops exist.
- Brand/legal approvals can keep pace.
- Adequate traffic for powered tests.

Metrics to watch:
- Conversion, activation, NPS, complaints; margin impacts.
- False‑positive/novelty decay; long‑term holdouts.
- Content QA and accessibility feedback.
