Title: Marketplace Take‑Rate and Balance
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Model supply/demand responses to take‑rate; simulate liquidity and welfare.
- Design incentives and fees; avoid adverse selection.
- Guard against collusion and unfairness.
- Pilot changes with geo or cohort splits.
- Track health metrics (fill rate, time‑to‑match, cancellation, NPS).
- Publish results and iterate.

Outputs:
- TAKE‑RATE scenarios and incentives.
- PILOT plan and guardrails.
- HEALTH metrics and outcomes.

Assumptions:
- Sides of the marketplace can be segmented and measured independently.
- Incentive changes will not trigger large adverse selection.
- Liquidity constraints are modeled with uncertainty bands.

Metrics to watch:
- Fill rate, time‑to‑match, conversion, cancellation; supply/demand NPS.
- Take‑rate vs churn, quality, and fraud.
- Liquidity heatmaps and regional imbalances.
