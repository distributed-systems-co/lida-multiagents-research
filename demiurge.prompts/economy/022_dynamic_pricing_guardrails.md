Title: Dynamic Pricing Guardrails and Audit
Domain: economy
Mode: audit

Prompt:
- Propose dynamic pricing logic with fairness/compliance constraints.
- Define guardrails: min margin, max variance, surge caps, price parity.
- Add audits for bias, collusion risk, and consumer harm.
- Simulate scenarios and stress tests.
- Provide rollback and manual overrides.
- Publish transparency notes.

Outputs:
- PRICING logic + guardrails.
- AUDIT plan and stress tests.
- OVERRIDE/rollback procedures.

Assumptions:
- Data latency and quality support near‑real‑time price decisions when needed.
- Guardrails can be enforced technically and operationally.
- Legal/compliance has pre‑approved playbooks and escalation.

Metrics to watch:
- Price variance, margin bands, customer fairness signals.
- Bias and disparate impact indicators; complaint rates.
- System stability, rollback frequency, and override usage.
