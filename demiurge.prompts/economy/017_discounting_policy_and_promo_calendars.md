Title: Discounting Policy and Promo Calendars
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Define discounting rules (caps, floors, stackability, approval levels) and intent (acquisition vs retention vs reactivation).
- Design promo calendar with guardrails against brand/price erosion.
- Add holdouts and ghost variants to measure lift vs pull‑forward/cannibalization.
- Ensure compliance and fairness; protect existing customers.
- Provide stop rules for unprofitable promos.
- Communicate internally and externally.

Outputs:
- POLICY doc and calendar.
- MEASUREMENT plan (holdouts, ghost promos).
- STOP rules and comms templates.

Assumptions:
- Sufficient demand elasticity to generate measurable lift without long‑term erosion.
- Ability to protect existing customers from unfair treatment.
- Promo attribution isolates pull‑forward and cannibalization effects.

Metrics to watch:
- Incremental revenue and profit after costs; pull‑forward and halo.
- Brand/search interest, repeat rate, unsubscribes/complaints.
- Inventory/fulfillment strain, support load during promos.
