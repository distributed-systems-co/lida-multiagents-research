Title: Contribution Margin and Product Mix Optimization
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Compute contribution margin by SKU/segment; include variable costs and promo leakage.
- Optimize product mix for profit under constraints (capacity, cannibalization, SLAs).
- Simulate price/mix scenarios; identify dominated options.
- Add governance for portfolio changes.
- Define measurement to verify realized margins.
- Plan review cadence and pruning.

Outputs:
- MARGIN table and model.
- PORTFOLIO optimization result and scenarios.
- GOVERNANCE and measurement.

Assumptions:
- Variable costs and promo leakage are measurable to acceptable error.
- Constraints (capacity, SLAs, brand) are enforced in optimization.
- Change management can handle portfolio adjustments.

Metrics to watch:
- Contribution margin by SKU/segment; portfolio margin uplift.
- Cannibalization, stockouts, and customer satisfaction.
- Execution risks: supply chain, quality, support load.
