Title: Multivariate Promo Optimization Under Constraints
Domain: economy
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Optimize promo parameters (discount, duration, audience, channel, creative) subject to constraints (margin, fairness, brand, inventory).
- Use bandits/BO for exploration with guardrails; include ghost promos for clean lift estimates.
- Penalize cannibalization/pull‑forward and include externalities (support load, returns).
- Provide pacing, fatigue controls, and exclusion lists.
- Publish policy, approvals, and transparency notes.
- Archive outcomes and playbooks.
- Schedule re‑optimization cadence and scenario testing.
- Enforce stop rules automatically.

Outputs:
- OPTIMIZATION setup (arms, priors, constraints) and policy.
- LIFT/ROI measurement and guardrail monitors.
- PLAYBOOK updates and archive plan.

Assumptions:
- Experimentation infra supports multivariate designs ethically.
- Inventory/supply can adapt without harm.
- Measurement captures all‑in costs.

Metrics to watch:
- Incremental profit, margin bands, guardrail breaches.
- Fatigue, complaints, returns; long‑term customer value.
- Diversity of exposure and fairness outcomes.
