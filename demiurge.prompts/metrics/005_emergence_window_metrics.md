Title: Emergence Windows — Metrics and Sensing
Domain: metrics
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Define metrics to detect phase transitions and emergent macro‑laws.
- Propose multi‑scale sensing and coarse‑to‑fine probes.
- Quantify intervention sensitivity and no‑signalling bounds.
- Determine when to freeze, snapshot, or let run.
- Provide statistical tests and stopping criteria.
- Describe how to report to inhabitants without collapsing exploration.

Outputs:
- METRIC set for emergence detection.
- PROBE plan and statistical tests.
- GOVERNANCE actions tied to signals.
