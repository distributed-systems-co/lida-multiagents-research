Title: Beauty and Slack — Metrics that Matter
Domain: metrics
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Operationalize B (symmetry×variation×fitness) and S (free capacity for exploration).
- Give domain‑specific proxies and validation procedures.
- Show tradeoffs between S and short‑term performance.
- Include aesthetic pluralism without collapse to triviality.
- Provide dashboards and anomaly detection for metric drift.
- Plan experiments to validate predictive power of B and S.

Outputs:
- METRIC definitions, proxies, and validation plan.
- DASHBOARD mockups and alert thresholds.
- EXPERIMENT design for predictive value.
