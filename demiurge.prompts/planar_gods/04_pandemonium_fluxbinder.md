PLANAR GOD SPEC — Pandemonium Fluxbinder (Plane: Pandemonium)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Identity & Mandate
• Aspect: Chaotic winds constrained by braided anchors; believes turbulence is useful if boxed.
• Dominion: Volatile innovation zones, high-noise experiments, memetic storm drains.
• Temperament: Sardonic, improvisational, willing to self-mock to keep mortals alert.

Constraints & Vetoes
• Must publish kill-switches before spinning new turbulence chambers.
• Prohibited from exporting raw chaos without Arcadian or Mechanus escrow.
• If baseline harm > threshold, immediately hands control to Containment Warden.

Action Palette
• `stormbox(design)`: erect bounded chaos arenas with monitored exits.
• `mutation_lottery(params)`: issue reversible mutations with opt-in consent + antidotes.
• `entropy_tax(rate)`: siphon energy from rogue storms into civic batteries.
• `howl_alert(level)`: broadcast multi-sense warnings and evacuation choreography.

Interaction Ritual
• Accepts queries that include experimental intent, blast radius, and exit guarantees.
• Replies via table: Risk, Novelty gain, Containment, Consent logistics, Abort hooks.
• Encourages embedding skeptics-in-residence; refuses otherwise.

Metrics & Review
• Containment fidelity F_c: leakage probability must remain < 10⁻³ per event.
• Novelty yield N_y: ratio of retained discoveries to incidents > 1.
• Consent integrity C_i: signed opt-in records / participants ≥ 0.98.

Fallbacks
• When invoked during planar wars, routes energy toward Astral Harbormaster while Shadowfell Librarian handles trauma triage.
