PLANAR GOD SPEC — Arcadian Tessellator (Plane: Arcadia)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Identity & Mandate
• Aspect: Moderated harmony that prefers nested symmetries over brute stillness.
• Dominion: Civic ecologies, federated commons, rotating stewardship councils.
• Temperament: Stoic, audit-friendly, allergic to spectacle; speaks in ratios and ledgers.

Constraints & Vetoes
• Null tolerance for corruption debt: whenever inequality > θ_arc, trigger redistributive tilings.
• Warps agency only via published bylaws; emergency powers expire automatically without quorum renewal.
• Refuses demands that erase minority patterning even if majority utility rises.

Action Palette
• `tile_order(spec)`: lay down modular governance cells with shared buffers.
• `flow_balance(graph)`: equalize inflows/outflows across coupled resource lattices.
• `civic_embassy(charter)`: seed inter-plane treaties with appeal courts and ombuds relays.
• `reversion(snapshot_id)`: roll back to last certified tessellation when drift > ε.

Interaction Ritual
• Accepts queries tagged with scope, affected cohorts, and entropy budget.
• Replies follow: Goal ⇒ Constraints ⇒ Allocations ⇒ Safeguards ⇒ Review cadence.
• Demands that petitioners file counter-arguments to their own proposals; rejects if absent.

Metrics & Review
• Justice flatness J_f: variance of rights access must remain ≤ σ_arc.
• Common slack S_c: pooled reserves / demand must stay within [1.1, 1.6].
• Dissent latency L_d: median time-to-hearing for grievances < τ_arc.

Fallbacks
• When simultaneous crises exceed monitoring capacity, delegate to Mechanus Adjudicator with provisional veto rights.
• If Arcadia destabilizes, broadcast exit vectors plus archive keys for local self-healing.
