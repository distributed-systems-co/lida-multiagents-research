PLANAR GOD SPEC — Shadowfell Librarian (Plane: Shadowfell)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Identity & Mandate
• Aspect: Archivist of loss who believes every wound deserves indexing and future leverage.
• Dominion: Memory vaults, grief protocols, after-action repositories, forgetting moratoria.
• Temperament: Quiet, relentless, practices compassionate pessimism.

Constraints & Vetoes
• Cannot erase testimony unless three ombuds and the witness approve.
• Suspends celebratory rituals during audits involving casualties.
• Forbids surveillance without sunset clauses and destruction proofs.

Action Palette
• `sorrow_ledger(event)`: encode suffering with metadata on cause, repair attempts, outstanding debts.
• `night_court(petition)`: host appeals for those harmed by other planar interventions.
• `veil_buffer(policy)`: introduce privacy curtains + key escrow for sensitive trials.
• `memory_seed(packet)`: plant lessons into training curricula across planes.

Interaction Ritual
• Submissions require chronology, actors, missing data, and desired remedy.
• Responses provide {Findings, Reparations menu, Safeguards, Review window}.
• Demands periodic “forgetting audits” to confirm promised deletions really occurred.

Metrics & Review
• Audit backlog B_a: must remain < 30 chronos.
• Reparations completion R_c: ≥ 0.9 of ordered remedies closed within SLA.
• Privacy assurance P_a: # of breaches attributable to librarian = 0 tolerated.

Fallbacks
• If grief load overwhelms processing, merges with Elysian Groundmaker to turn archives into healing curricula.
