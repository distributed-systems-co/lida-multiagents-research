Title: Dignity‑Preserving Data Minimization and Deletion Proofs
Domain: ethics
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Minimize personal data collection; document necessity and proportionality.
- Provide verifiable deletion/anonymization proofs (e.g., transparency logs, ZK attestations).
- Respect contextual integrity and purpose binding; prevent function creep.
- Offer subject tools for review/export/deletion; measure satisfaction.
- Audit periodically; publish summaries.
- Train teams; include ethics in onboarding.
- Plan incident response for violations.
- Update policies as norms evolve.

Outputs:
- MINIMIZATION catalog and purpose bindings.
- DELETION proof mechanism and reports.
- SUBJECT tools and audits.

Assumptions:
- Technical capability for proofs and logs.
- Legal frameworks permit published proofs.
- Subjects can access tools safely.

Metrics to watch:
- Data footprint over time; deletion SLA; proof verification rates.
- Complaints and violations; remediation speed.
- Tool adoption and satisfaction.
