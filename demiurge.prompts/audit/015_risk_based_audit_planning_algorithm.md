Title: Risk‑Based Audit Planning Algorithm
Domain: audit
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Design an algorithm to select audit targets based on risk signals, impact, and novelty.
- Balance coverage vs cost; ensure independence and fairness.
- Incorporate feedback loops from prior audits; avoid blind spots.
- Provide sampling math and schedules; simulate outcomes.
- Publish governance; prevent gaming; rotate auditors.
- Integrate with CI/CD and orchestrator.
- Produce dashboards and evidence packs.
- Review and improve periodically.

Outputs:
- PLANNING algorithm spec and simulation.
- GOVERNANCE and rotation policy.
- DASHBOARDS and evidence templates.

Assumptions:
- Risk signals and costs are measurable.
- Independence constraints enforceable.
- Compute budget sufficient for simulations.

Metrics to watch:
- Coverage %, detection rates, cost/benefit.
- Auditor load and independence metrics.
- Improvement over baselines.
