Domain: audit

- Optimize for fairness, coverage, and skill matching.
- Provide overrides with approvals and logs.
- Publish policy; train coordinators.
- Integrate with audit planning.
- Monitor for violations; remediate quickly.
- Archive decisions.

Outputs:
- SCHEDULER spec and policy.
- OVERRIDE workflows and logs.
- MONITORING and remediation plan.

Assumptions:
- Accurate auditor metadata; privacy respected.
- Policy constraints are machine‑representable.
- Org buy‑in for scheduler outcomes.

Metrics to watch:
- Violations, override rates, distribution fairness.
- Coverage/skill match quality.
- Coordinator satisfaction and cycle time.
