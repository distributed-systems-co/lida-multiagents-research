Title: Multi‑Agent Ecological Simulation Governance
Domain: ecology
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Govern simulations with multiple adaptive agents/species; constrain harmful dynamics.
- Define rules for resource use, reproduction, competition/cooperation, and mutation bounds.
- Add observation policies; avoid collapse of exploration via over‑control.
- Provide ethics: sentience thresholds, rights, and opt‑out mechanisms.
- Simulate shocks and policy changes; measure robustness.
- Publish transparency summaries and data access policies.
- Archive runs and parameter sets; enable reproducibility.
- Review policies periodically.

Outputs:
- GOVERNANCE rules and ethics charter.
- SIMULATION protocols and datasets.
- ROBUSTNESS results and transparency notes.

Assumptions:
- Agents/species models available; compute budgets defined.
- Ethics oversight in place; privacy constraints met.
- Storage for archives provisioned.

Metrics to watch:
- Diversity indices, collapse frequency, sentience flags.
- Robustness under shocks; fairness in outcomes.
- Reproducibility rate and documentation coverage.
