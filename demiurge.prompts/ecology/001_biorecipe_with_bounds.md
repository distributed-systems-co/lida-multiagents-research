Title: Biorecipe with Ethical Bounds
Domain: ecology
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Propose a biorecipe (metabolism, replication, adaptation) with safety gates.
- Bound mutation/error rates and resource budgets explicitly.
- Add kill‑switches and consent-aware elevation to sentience.
- Model ecological interactions and trophic balance.
- Plan monitoring and intervention triggers.
- Provide rollback and decommissioning path.

Outputs:
- BIORECIPE spec and safety gates.
- ECOLOGICAL impact model.
- ROLLBACK/decommission plan.
