Title: Trophic Balance and Noise Tuning
Domain: ecology
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Ensure energy flows support diversity without collapse.
- Tune stochastic noise to allow evolution but preserve structure.
- Simulate perturbations and recovery dynamics.
- Define early‑warning indicators for regime shifts.
- Add quarantine plans for invasive dynamics.
- Document ethical considerations for interventions.

Outputs:
- BALANCE model and noise parameters.
- PERTURBATION tests and thresholds.
- INTERVENTION and quarantine plan.
