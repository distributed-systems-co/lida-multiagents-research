Title: Hierarchical Decomposition and Interface Contracts
Domain: planning
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Decompose work into layers with clear interfaces and invariants.
- Define inputs/outputs per module; specify pre/postconditions.
- Establish error handling and backpressure across layers.
- Create stubs/mocks for parallel development and testing.
- Tie contracts to metrics and kill criteria.
- Plan change management and versioning of interfaces.

Outputs:
- DECOMPOSITION map and interface specs.
- TEST plan with stubs/mocks.
- VERSIONING and change control policy.
