- planning/015_multi_scale_temporal_program_orchestration.md — cross‑scale contracts and cadences.
- simulation/014_causality_kernels_and_event_algebra.md — event algebra and causal kernels.
- chronicle/014_temporal_causal_trace_graphs.md — causal trace graphs and queries.
- audit/014_temporal_causal_replay_and_counterfactuals.md — replay and counterfactual audits.
- metrics/014_causal_mediation_and_distributed_lag_models.md — mediation and lag effects.
- safety/014_temporal_risk_propagation_maps.md — hazard chains and mitigations.
- law/014_temporal_consistency_and_sunset_governance.md — effective windows and precedence.
- explain/014_temporal_causal_maps_for_humans.md — human‑friendly temporal maps.
- snapshot/014_timewarp_consistency_and_branch_alignment.md — timewarp + merge with fairness.

Notes:
- Each prompt includes Outputs, Assumptions, and Metrics to watch, ensuring operational depth and length.
- Use these as a cohesive “meta‑orchestrator” kit to align planning, simulation, evidence, audits, and human communication over time.
