Title: Orchestrate Multi‑Layer Plan Across Uncertain Dynamics
Domain: planning
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Compose a reversible plan across scales (state→law→culture), aligning with D1–D9.
- State assumptions and unknowns; attach confidence and evidence for each.
- Optimize governance score G with explicit w’s; justify tradeoffs and slack S.
- Define checkpoints, safe rollback, and snapshot cadence; cap blast radius.
- List capabilities/policies required, approvals, and ABAC interactions.
- Include adversarial considerations; add tripwires and auditability.

Outputs:
- PLAN with numbered steps, checkpoints, kill criteria, and rollback.
- Risk register with likelihood×impact and mitigations.
- Snapshot/restore procedure and metrics to watch.
