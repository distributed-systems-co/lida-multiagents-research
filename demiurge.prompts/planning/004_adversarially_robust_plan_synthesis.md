Title: Adversarially‑Robust Plan Synthesis
Domain: planning
Mode: audit

Prompt:
- Generate a plan resilient to strategic interference and worst‑case noise.
- Model adversary capabilities and budget; stress test critical paths.
- Add redundancy, diversity, and compartmentalization; quantify blast‑radius.
- Include detection, escalation, and quarantine playbooks.
- Propose telemetry for early anomaly detection and graceful degrade.
- Document residual risks and acceptable exposure with justification.

Outputs:
- PLAN with adversarial countermeasures and escalation matrix.
- STRESS scenarios with expected vs observed behaviors.
- AUDIT checklist and telemetry schema.
