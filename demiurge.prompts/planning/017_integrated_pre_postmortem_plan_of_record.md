Title: Integrated Pre‑Mortem and Post‑Mortem Plan‑of‑Record
Domain: planning
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Combine pre‑mortem (failure imagination) with post‑mortem (evidence) into a single plan‑of‑record artifact.
- Enumerate top failure modes, tripwires, and countermeasures; attach owners and time windows.
- Define evidence to collect during execution for future learning and accountability.
- Bind rollback and freeze criteria to pre‑mortem scenarios; log actuals to compare.
- Publish a minimal schema and templates; wire to Chronicle with correlation_ids.
- Require review gates and ombuds sign‑off for high‑impact risks.
- Reconcile gaps after execution; update playbooks and policies.
- Schedule recurrences and retention of artifacts.

Outputs:
- PLAN‑OF‑RECORD template and a filled example.
- FAILURE mode register with tripwires and owners.
- EVIDENCE schema and review outcomes.

Assumptions:
- Teams can invest time pre‑execution; post‑mortem culture is blameless.
- Chronicle and metrics are trustworthy; approvals are timely.
- Privacy/compliance clearances for evidence are secured.

Metrics to watch:
- Tripwire detection latency, false rates; rollback success.
- Gap closure time from post‑mortems; recurrence rate of issues.
- Review cadence adherence and ombuds escalations.
