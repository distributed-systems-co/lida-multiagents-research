Title: Zero‑Knowledge Proofs of Consent and Processing
Domain: consent
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Design ZK proof schemes to attest consent and policy‑compliant processing without revealing contents.
- Integrate with logs and audit; support selective disclosure.
- Provide subject verifiers and public tools.
- Manage keys and revocation; protect privacy.
- Pilot with narrow scope; measure feasibility.
- Publish results and next steps.
- Train teams; update governance.
- Archive artifacts.

Outputs:
- ZK proof design and pilot.
- VERIFIERS and tools.
- GOVERNANCE and roadmap.

Assumptions:
- Cryptographic expertise/tools available.
- Legal frameworks permit ZK attestations.
- Systems can integrate proofs.

Metrics to watch:
- Proof verification rates; performance; user adoption.
- Privacy incidents (should be zero); complaints.
- Pilot expansion readiness.
