Title: Define Safety Envelopes and Tripwires
Domain: safety
Mode: audit

Prompt:
- Enumerate operational envelopes for core processes; codify hard bounds and soft nudges.
- Tie tripwires to measurable signals; define thresholds and hysteresis.
- Map responses: nudge → quarantine → rollback; include human‑in‑the‑loop.
- Propose ψ‑sentience guardrails and rights activation paths.
- Define logging granularity with privacy safeguards.
- Show test cases and drills for each tripwire.

Outputs:
- SAFETY matrix (signal→threshold→action→owner).
- DRILLS and verification scenarios.
- LOGGING plan with retention and access controls.
