Title: Safety Case (GSN) and Assurance Evidence
Domain: safety
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Develop a Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) safety case: goals, strategies, assumptions, context, and solutions.
- Map controls and monitors to goals; define assurance claims and required evidence.
- Build an evidence collection plan (tests, audits, logs) with signatures and retention.
- Validate completeness and identify undeveloped arguments; add plans to resolve.
- Tie safety case to rollout gates (observe→warn→enforce) and ombuds oversight.
- Ensure privacy and ethics constraints are encoded in arguments.
- Publish a reviewer guide and acceptance checklist; link to Chronicle.
- Schedule periodic review and delta cases for changes.

Outputs:
- GSN safety case diagram and narrative.
- ASSURANCE plan and evidence registry schema.
- REVIEW checklist and cadence.

Assumptions:
- Controls and monitors are measurable; evidence can be collected without harm.
- Reviewers have access and independence.
- Versioning of arguments is supported.

Metrics to watch:
- Open undeveloped arguments; evidence freshness; review findings.
- Incident trends vs claims; false assurances detected.
- Reviewer SLA adherence and independence signals.
