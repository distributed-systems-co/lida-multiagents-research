Title: Forecast Under Uncertainty
Domain: simulation
Mode: fast

Prompt:
- Produce forecasts with calibrated uncertainty and scenario bands.
- State priors, likelihoods, and model limitations.
- Include alternative model families for robustness.
- Provide short‑term checkpoints and divergence alarms.
- Note actions that would invalidate the forecast.
- Plan updates and rolling windows.

Outputs:
- FORECAST with CI bands and scenarios.
- MODEL notes and comparison.
- UPDATE cadence and alarms.
