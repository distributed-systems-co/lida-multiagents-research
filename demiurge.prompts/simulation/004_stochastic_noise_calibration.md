Title: Stochastic Noise Calibration
Domain: simulation
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Choose noise families and parameters; justify by theory and empirics.
- Show effect on emergence and stability.
- Provide adaptive noise schedules if helpful.
- Add tests for invariants under noise.
- Define alarms for chaotic regimes.
- Document reproducibility and seeds.

Outputs:
- NOISE spec and rationale.
- TESTS for invariants under noise.
- ADAPTIVE schedules and alarms.
