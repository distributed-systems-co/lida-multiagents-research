Title: Variance Reduction Techniques
Domain: simulation
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Apply variance reduction (control variates, antithetic, stratified).
- Show convergence improvements.
- Track bias vs variance tradeoffs.
- Provide reproducible seeds.
- Integrate in benchmarks.
- Document best practices.

Outputs:
- TECHNIQUES and examples.
- CONVERGENCE and tradeoffs.
- BENCHMARK integration.
