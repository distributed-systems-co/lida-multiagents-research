Title: Multi‑World Ensemble Methods
Domain: simulation
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Run ensembles across world variants to assess robustness.
- Define parameter sweeps and sampling.
- Aggregate results with uncertainty bands.
- Detect bifurcations and safe corridors.
- Publish reproducible configs and seeds.
- Tie to decision thresholds.

Outputs:
- ENSEMBLE designs and configs.
- AGGREGATION metrics and bands.
- DECISION thresholds and artifacts.
