Title: Deterministic Replay and Chaos Diagnostics
Domain: simulation
Mode: audit

Prompt:
- Provide deterministic replay for debugging and audits.
- Diagnose chaos via Lyapunov proxies and divergence tests.
- Bound replay fidelity vs performance costs.
- Store seeds and event logs safely.
- Define acceptable divergence envelopes.
- Publish tools and procedures.

Outputs:
- REPLAY tools and specs.
- DIAGNOSTICS and thresholds.
- STORAGE and retention plan.
