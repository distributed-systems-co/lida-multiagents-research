Title: Explorable Explanations and Sandboxes
Domain: explain
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Build explorable demos where stakeholders manipulate assumptions and see outcomes.
- Provide sandboxes with safe data and reversible states; no harm to real users.
- Offer presets (typical scenarios) and open‑ended mode.
- Explain uncertainty, constraints, and guardrails clearly.
- Collect feedback and questions; iterate content.
- Ensure accessibility and localization.
- Publish links and documentation; archive to Chronicle.
- Measure learning outcomes.

Outputs:
- EXPLORABLE demos and docs.
- SANDBOX instances and safety plan.
- LEARNING metrics and feedback.

Assumptions:
- Safe synthetic or redacted datasets exist.
- Infra can host sandboxes with rollbacks.
- Users have time to explore.

Metrics to watch:
- Engagement, comprehension improvements, question patterns.
- Sandbox safety incidents (should be zero).
- Iteration velocity and content freshness.
