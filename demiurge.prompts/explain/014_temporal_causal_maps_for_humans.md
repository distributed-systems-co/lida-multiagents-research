Title: Temporal Causal Maps for Humans
Domain: explain
Mode: careful

Prompt:
- Produce human‑readable temporal causal maps explaining how actions lead to outcomes over time.
- Choose minimal metaphors; add timelines with milestones, lags, and checkpoints.
- Mark where uncertainty is highest and why; include “what would change our minds”.
- Show safeguards, approvals, and rollback windows clearly.
- Provide ways to participate, opt‑out, or appeal.
- Localize and ensure accessibility.
- Keep concise while complete; avoid overload.
- Commit to updates and corrections.

Outputs:
- MAPS (visual/ASCII) and short brief.
- UNCERTAINTY notes and reversal signals.
- SAFEGUARD/appeal guidance and review date.

Assumptions:
- Audiences differ; versions may be needed.
- Sensitive details can be abstracted safely.
- Data sources are linkable for verification.

Metrics to watch:
- Comprehension, trust signals, follow‑up questions.
- Complaint rates about clarity/fairness.
- Update cadence and error corrections.

Procedure:
- Identify audience segments and reading levels; define tailored map variants if needed.
- Draft timeline with milestones, actions, lags, checkpoints; mark uncertainty and safeguards.
- Add plain‑language explanations; minimize jargon; include “what would change our minds”.
- Provide how to participate/opt‑out/appeal with contacts and SLAs.
- Ensure accessibility (contrast, alt text, keyboard nav, captions) and localization.
- Dry‑run with sample audience; capture questions and confusions; iterate.
- Publish in accessible formats (HTML/PDF/ASCII) and archive to Chronicle.
- Schedule updates; track feedback and corrections.

Artifacts:
- Timeline diagram + ASCII version; one‑page brief; FAQ; accessibility report; localization notes.

Acceptance criteria:
- Comprehension test > target; feedback addressed; appeal info clear.
- Accessibility checklist passes; localization validated; Chronicle archived.
