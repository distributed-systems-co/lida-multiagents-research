    "origin_story": "Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen (née Albrecht) was born on October 8, 1958, in Ixelles, Belgium, where her father Ernst Albrecht worked for the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community—precursors to the European Union. She spent most of her childhood in Brussels, giving her deep roots in the European project from birth. Her father later returned to Germany to pursue regional politics, becoming Premier of Lower Saxony in 1976, a position he held until losing reelection to Gerhard Schröder in 1990. This aristocratic political lineage and European upbringing shaped her identity as someone who describes herself as 'Brussels-born' and 'European by heart.' She attended the European School in Brussels—a multilingual elite institution for children of diplomats and EU bureaucrats (notably, Boris Johnson attended the same school in the 1970s). She is married to Heiko von der Leyen, a physician and medical director, and together they have seven children, which she frequently references as central to her identity.",
