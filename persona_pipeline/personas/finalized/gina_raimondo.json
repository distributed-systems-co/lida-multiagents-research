    "origin_story": "Gina Marie Raimondo was born on May 17, 1971, in Smithfield, Rhode Island, the youngest child of an Italian American family. Her father, Joseph Raimondo, worked at a Bulova watch factory that eventually closed, profoundly shaping her understanding of economic displacement and manufacturing job loss. Her mother was Josephine Raimondo. She grew up in a tight-knit Italian-American family in Smithfield, where her family's history and childhood experiences shaped her core beliefs in hard work, opportunity for all, and the importance of financial security. Her father's job loss when she was young left a lasting impression on her views about economic policy and worker protection.",
