  "background": {
    "origin_story": "Lee Hsien Loong was born on 10 February 1952 in Singapore as the eldest child of Lee Kuan Yew and Kwa Geok Choo. His father served as Singapore's first Prime Minister from 1959 to 1990, leading the country through independence and early nation-building. His mother, Kwa Geok Choo, was a prominent lawyer. Growing up in a politically influential family, Lee was exposed to politics from a young age - at age 11, he tagged along in an open-air Land Rover truck as his father traveled around Singapore campaigning for the merger with Malaysia. He learned Jawi script as a young child, reflecting the multicultural education his father valued. His family background as the son of Singapore's founding father shaped his trajectory toward public service and leadership.",
    "education": "Lee Hsien Loong attended Catholic High School in Singapore, which his father cited as an example of how different religions can coexist peacefully. He pursued higher education at the University of Cambridge, where he excelled academically. He obtained a degree in Mathematics with First Class Honours and also earned a Diploma in Computer Science. He later attended Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, earning a Master in Public Administration (MPA). His educational background reflects exceptional intellectual capability, particularly in mathematics and computing - interests he would maintain throughout his career.",
    "career_arc": "After completing his education, Lee embarked on a distinguished 13-year military career in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), rising to the rank of Brigadier-General. In 1984, he transitioned to politics, being elected as a Member of Parliament for Teck Ghee, winning more than 80 percent of the vote. He served on the PAP Youth Committee early in his political career. He held various ministerial positions, including Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister of Finance. In October 1990, he became Deputy Prime Minister under Goh Chok Tong. On 12 August 2004, he was sworn in as Singapore's third Prime Minister. He served as Prime Minister for 20 years until 15 May 2024, when he handed over leadership to Lawrence Wong. He currently serves as Senior Minister and remains a Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC. He also serves on the Board of Directors of GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund.",
    "net_worth": "Not publicly disclosed, though as a long-serving Prime Minister and Senior Minister of Singapore, he receives one of the highest government salaries in the world. Singapore's ministerial salaries are benchmarked against top private sector earnings."
