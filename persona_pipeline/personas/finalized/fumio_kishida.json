Growing up in a politically connected household shaped Kishida's worldview and career trajectory. The family has deep roots in Hiroshima, which would become central to his political identity and his advocacy for nuclear disarmament. His upbringing instilled in him what observers describe as a characteristically 'low-key and humble' demeanor that would define his political style.",
