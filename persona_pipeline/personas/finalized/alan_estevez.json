    "origin_story": "Alan F. Estevez is an 'outspoken New Jersey native' who spent 30+ years in senior government service between the Departments of Commerce and Defense. In 2021, while sitting at his dining room table in a T-shirt, Secretary Gina Raimondo called on Zoom asking him to return from retirement to be Biden's top export control official. His response: 'You're going to have to sell me on this.' He thought he had finally left public service behind but was drawn back for what became one of the most consequential national security roles of the administration.",
