    "origin_story": "Marco Antonio Rubio was born on May 28, 1971, in Miami, Florida, to Cuban immigrant parents Mario Rubio and Oria Garcia. His parents came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover of Cuba, though they actually arrived before Castro took power in 1959, which became a point of controversy when Rubio's timeline was scrutinized. His father worked as a bartender, notably at the Sam's Town Hotel in Las Vegas, while his mother worked as a housekeeper at the Imperial Palace. When Marco was eight years old, the family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where they lived for several years before returning to Florida. This working-class immigrant background has been central to Rubio's political narrative, emphasizing the American Dream story of children of immigrants rising to prominence.",
