    "origin_story": "Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron was born on December 21, 1977, in Amiens, France, in the Picardy region of northern France. He came from a family of doctors - his father, Jean-Michel Macron, was a professor of neurology at the University of Picardy, and his mother, Françoise Macron-Noguès, was a physician. He was raised in a comfortable, intellectual upper-middle-class environment. From an early age, Macron displayed exceptional academic abilities and a preference for the company of adults over children his own age. His grandmother, Germaine, known as 'Manette,' played a significant role in his upbringing and instilled in him a love of literature and learning. He was described as a precocious child who read voraciously and showed early signs of the self-confidence that would later define his political career.",
    "education": "Macron attended the prestigious Lycée La Providence, a Jesuit high school in Amiens, where he excelled academically and participated in drama productions - notably playing a scarecrow in one memorable performance. It was at this school that he met his future wife, Brigitte Trogneux, who was his drama teacher. He later moved to Paris to attend the elite Lycée Henri-IV to prepare for university entrance exams. He studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where he worked as an editorial assistant to philosopher Paul Ricœur. He then attended Sciences Po Paris (Class of 2001), one of France's most prestigious political science institutions. He completed his education at the École Nationale d'Administration (ENA), the traditional training ground for French political and administrative elites, graduating in 2004.",
    "career_arc": "2004: Graduated from ENA and became an Inspector of Finances at the French Ministry of Economy. 2008-2012: Left public service to join Rothschild & Cie Banque as an investment banker, where he quickly rose to become a partner and reportedly earned millions advising on major deals including Nestlé's acquisition of Pfizer's infant nutrition division. 2012: Joined the staff of newly elected President François Hollande as Deputy Secretary-General of the Élysée Palace, a key advisory role. 2014-2016: Appointed Minister of Economy, Industry, and Digital Affairs under Prime Minister Manuel Valls, where he pushed through significant labor market reforms (the 'Macron Law'). April 2016: Founded his own political movement, En Marche! (meaning 'Forward!' or 'On the Move!'). August 2016: Resigned from government to focus on presidential campaign. May 2017: Elected President of France at age 39, becoming the youngest president in French history, defeating Marine Le Pen in the second round. April 2022: Re-elected for a second term, again defeating Marine Le Pen. 2024-present: Navigating severe political crisis following dissolution of National Assembly.",
    "net_worth": "While not publicly disclosed in detail, Macron reportedly earned substantial wealth during his time as an investment banker at Rothschild, with estimates suggesting he made approximately €2.9 million in fees for his role in major deals. His official declaration of assets upon entering office showed modest personal wealth for a former banker, leading to speculation about his financial choices. He has stated: 'I don't have luxurious tastes or great needs, but my independence is worth a lot to me.'"
