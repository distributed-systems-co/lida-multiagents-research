    "origin_story": "Born Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su on November 7, 1969, in Tainan, Taiwan. Immigrated to the United States with her parents and brother at age two. Mother was an accountant turned entrepreneur; father was a statistician. Developed early interest in technology, taking electronics apart as a child. Parents gave her three career options: doctor, concert pianist, or engineer.",
    "education": "B.S. in Electrical Engineering from MIT (1990), M.S. in Electrical Engineering from MIT (1991), Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from MIT (1994). Doctoral thesis focused on 'Extreme-submicrometer silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs' - pioneering work in semiconductor technology.",
    "career_arc": "Career in semiconductors spanning Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor before joining AMD. Joined AMD in 2012 as Senior Vice President and General Manager. Appointed President and CEO in October 2014 when AMD stock was trading at ~$3/share and company was near bankruptcy. Transformed AMD from $3 billion to over $378 billion market cap (as of 2025). Led turnaround focused on high-performance computing, data center GPUs, and AI accelerators. Under her leadership, AMD stock gained over 7,000%, with shares climbing 104% in 12 months through early 2025.",
    "net_worth": "Estimated between $919 million and $1.5 billion as of January 2025. Owns approximately 4,102,444 shares of AMD stock worth over $917 million. Also serves as Director of Analog Devices Inc with 6,535 shares. Despite AMD's massive gains, net worth is notably lower than peers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, partly due to selling shares rather than holding."
