    "origin_story": "Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, the fourth of five children to Frederick Christ Trump Sr. and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His father was a stern and demanding real estate developer born in New York City to German immigrants. His mother was born in Scotland and emigrated to the United States in 1930. Growing up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, Trump was raised in an environment where his father instilled the lesson that there were only two kinds of people in the world: 'winners' or 'killers' and 'losers.' According to Tony Schwartz, who ghostwrote 'The Art of the Deal,' Trump's relationship with his demanding father likely accounts for much of what he became. Trump was described as a difficult child who was sent to military school to channel his aggressive tendencies.",

      "high_school": "New York Military Academy (8th grade through high school) - sent there reportedly due to behavioral issues and his father's desire to instill discipline",
      "undergraduate": "Started at Fordham University, then transferred to the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a bachelor's degree. His grades remain under lock and key, with threats of lawsuits against both institutions if they reveal his academic records. He did not receive an honors degree, indicating a GPA below 3.4/4.0. He was reportedly not well-regarded by professors or the university at large."
