    "origin_story": "Born May 14, 1984 in White Plains, New York. Started programming at age 12. Created Facemash in October 2003 at Harvard - a 'hot or not' site that ranked students' photos - out of anger after being dumped by his girlfriend. This act of spite led to disciplinary action but also planted the seed for Facebook. Launched 'TheFacebook' from his Harvard dorm room on February 4, 2004 with roommates Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum.",
    "education": "Attended Phillips Exeter Academy (prep school). Enrolled at Harvard University in 2002, dropped out in 2004 during sophomore year to focus on Facebook full-time. Never completed his degree, though Harvard awarded him an honorary doctorate years later.",
    "career_arc": "2004: Founded Facebook at age 19. 2004-2005: Moved to Palo Alto, diluted and eventually forced out co-founder Eduardo Saverin in what became a bitter legal battle. 2012: Took Facebook public in May, one of largest tech IPOs in history. 2012-2018: Acquired Instagram (2012), WhatsApp (2014), Oculus (2014). 2018-2021: Survived Cambridge Analytica scandal, multiple congressional hearings, and endless privacy controversies. 2021: Rebranded Facebook to Meta, pivoting toward metaverse/VR with massive financial losses. 2023-2025: Shifted focus to AI, open-source models (Llama), and competing directly with OpenAI. January 2025: Eliminated fact-checkers, adopted Community Notes model, signaling rightward political shift.",
