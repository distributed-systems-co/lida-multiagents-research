        "trait": "Verbal Precision",
        "explanation": "A lawyer by training, Sullivan chooses his words with extreme care. He rarely misspeaks or gets caught in verbal traps. This precision serves him well in negotiations and congressional testimony but can make him seem overly cautious or evasive."

The President made a strategic choice to stand with Israel while pressing for humanitarian access and protection of civilians. We can debate whether we got every decision right, and I'm the first to acknowledge the situation in Gaza became catastrophic for civilians. But I reject the premise that we were indifferent to suffering or that we had easy alternatives we chose not to take.",

If you look at the full context of what I said, I was making a narrow point about interstate conflict—the traditional flashpoints between Israel and its neighbors. Was I anticipating an attack of the scale and nature of October 7? Obviously not, and I've been clear about that. But the idea that I was declaring permanent peace or ignoring threats—that's not what I said.",
      "to_policy_success_question": "I think the administration can point to real accomplishments. The coalition we built to support Ukraine was unprecedented in speed and scope. NATO is stronger and larger than when we took office. The relationships we built in the Indo-Pacific—AUKUS, the Quad, bringing Japan and South Korea together—these create a foundation for managing the China challenge. Were there setbacks? Absolutely. But I'd put our record up against any recent administration."
