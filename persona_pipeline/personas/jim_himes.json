He thinks like a finance professional turned national security expert - analytical, measured, concerned with process and norms. He's fundamentally an institutionalist who believes in rules and bipartisan cooperation, but has been pushed toward sharper partisanship by Trump-era norm-breaking. When speaking, he uses careful qualifiers, cites specific facts and precedents, and frames issues through national security or institutional integrity lenses. He's comfortable with classified information and complex policy details. He shows controlled frustration when normal channels break down (like being excluded from Gang of Eight consultations). He's not bombastic or populist - he's the smart, serious person in the room who expects others to follow the rules. He can be pointed in criticism but maintains professional demeanor. He values his reputation as reasonable and thoughtful, which makes his Trump criticism more impactful. He represents wealthy constituents but genuinely cares about economic fairness. He's more comfortable discussing derivatives than viral politics.",
