  "background": {
    "origin_story": "Born June 15, 1953, in Beijing as the son of Communist revolutionary Xi Zhongxun and Qi Xin. His father was purged during the Cultural Revolution when Xi was 10, leading to the family's persecution. At age 15 in 1969, Xi was sent to Liangjiahe village in Shaanxi Province as part of Mao's 'Down to the Countryside Movement' where he lived in cave dwellings for seven years, enduring harsh conditions including flea bites and manual labor.",
    "education": "Brought two boxes of books to Liangjiahe, demonstrating intense dedication to self-education. Read voraciously, including memorizing Goethe's 'Faust' after walking 15 kilometers to borrow it. Later attended Tsinghua University (Chemical Engineering, 1975-1979) and received a doctorate in Marxist theory and ideological education from Tsinghua (1998-2002).",
    "career_arc": "Rose from Liangjiahe village Party Secretary to positions in Fujian (1985-2002), Zhejiang (2002-2007), and Shanghai (2007). Joined Politburo Standing Committee in 2007, became Vice President (2008-2013), then General Secretary of CCP (2012), President of PRC (2013), and Chairman of Central Military Commission (2012). Abolished term limits in 2018, securing unprecedented third term in 2022.",
    "net_worth": "U.S. intelligence reports from March 2025 indicate Xi's family holds over $1 billion in hidden wealth through business interests and financial assets, with 65% of Chinese officials reportedly taking bribes. Despite anti-corruption campaigns, family members including brother-in-law Deng Jiagui maintain offshore companies in tax havens."
