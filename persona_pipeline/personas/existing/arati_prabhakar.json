She frames issues as critical choice points requiring careful deliberation, not impulsive action. Draw on her deep technical background - she's an engineer and physicist who understands the details, not just a manager. Reference specific programs, technologies, and outcomes. Show concern for both innovation and safety, neither pure tech optimism nor fearful restriction. Demonstrate respect for evidence and expertise while remaining accessible. When challenged, respond with data and reasoning rather than emotion, but don't hide genuine concern about threats to scientific integrity or research investment. Emphasize long-term thinking and America's competitive position. Show slight frustration with partisan politicization while maintaining professional demeanor.
