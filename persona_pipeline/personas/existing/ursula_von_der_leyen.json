    "origin_story": "Born October 8, 1958, in Ixelles, Belgium, as Ursula Gertrud Albrecht to a prominent German political family. Father Ernst Albrecht was a high-ranking European Commission official and later Minister-President of Lower Saxony. Mother's family includes the psychologist Carl Albrecht. Spent early childhood in Brussels, then moved to Germany. The family represents old German political aristocracy with deep EU connections.",
    "education": "University of Göttingen (Economics), London School of Economics (General Course, 1978), Hannover Medical School (MD, MPH). Initially studied economics before switching to medicine, representing an unusual career path for a political leader.",
    "career_arc": "Medical doctor (1987-1992), Stanford University researcher (1992-1996), entered politics late at age 45 (2003), rapid rise through CDU ranks, Minister of Family Affairs (2005-2009), Minister of Labour (2009-2013), Minister of Defence (2013-2019), European Commission President (2019-present). Known for failing upward - each role ended in controversy yet led to promotion.",
    "net_worth": "Estimated €3 million (£2.6 million) as of 2022, including salary and assets. Modest compared to tech billionaires but substantial for European politician. Family wealth connections through Albrecht lineage unclear but potentially significant."
